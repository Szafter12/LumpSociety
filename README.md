# LumpSociety

This is a project of a fictional e-commerce store, which was a credit project in technical school. Store was created by using PHP and MySql. Project created on my own. Thanks to this project, I learned a lot when it comes to combining the backend with the frontend, and thanks to it I mastered the PHP and SQL language to a very good degree.

## Appendix

As far as the design is concerned, I modelled it on the existing Hills shop. Likewise, the clothing graphics are from that shop and I have no rights to them. I only used them for learning purposes. Website in Polish.
